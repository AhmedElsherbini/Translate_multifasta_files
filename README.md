# Translate_multifasta_files 

This simple Python3 script aims to translate DNA multi-FASTA files into protein files using the 1st reading frame.

## Usage
If you have one single file

```bash
 python3 translate_multifasta_file.py -i test1.afa

```
If you have many files with the same extension

```bash
 python3 translate_multifasta_file.py -b .afa
```
As dependencies, you need to have Biopython, fnmatch, and argparse (via pip3 or conda)
